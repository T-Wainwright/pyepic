Introduction
************

PyEPIC is a simple wrapper around the EPIC API code. It is designed to allow users to integrate with EPIC for the submission and management of HPC jobs.
PyEPIC wraps the autogenerated API code. The autogenerated code can be used directly and is available on PyPi as `epiccore <https://pypi.org/project/epiccore/>`_ .

PyEPIC can be used as a reference for making use of the epiccore.

The REST API documentation can be viewed in epic at `https://epic.zenotech.com/api/explorer/ <https://epic.zenotech.com/api/explorer/>`_  or  `https://epic.zenotech.com/api/docs/ <https://epic.zenotech.com/api/docs/>`_

Installation
************

Python 3.4+ is required. The package can be installed from PyPi using pip.

``pip install pyepic``

To use the API you will need an 'API token'. This can be retieved by logging into EPIC and viewing the API Token section on the Your Profile -> Your Credentials page.
