Introduction
************
PyEPIC is a simple wrapper around the EPIC API code. It is designed to allow users to integrate with EPIC for the submission and management of HPC jobs.
PyEPIC wraps the autogenerated API code. This code can be used directly and is available on PyPi as 'epiccore'. PyEPIC can be used as a reference for making use of the epiccore.
The REST API documentation can be viewed in epic at https:/epic.zenotech.com/api/explorer/ or https:/epic.zenotech.com/api/docs/

Installation

The package can be installed from PyPi using pip.
